# Road Tripping Accross the United States

Group 6 Members: Sally Mei, Debolina Bhaumik, Cole Barnes, Kanu Madhok


## Topic Overview
Summer vacation time is here, but covid is still around. Trying to plan a road trip across the United States while keeping everyoneâ€™s health in 
mind can be tricky. Using the Covid Dashboard, users can easily identify which areas to avoid. 

To view deployed web appliciation visit:

- In terms of covid19 deaths per state, users will be able to see new deaths, deaths last 7 days, deaths in last 7 days/100K, total deaths, and total deaths/100k.

- For covid19 cases per state, users will be able to see new cases, cases last 7 days, cases in last 7 days/100K, total cases, and total cases/100k.

- In terms of total doses administered per state, users will be able to see total doses administered, total doses adminstered rate (per 100K of total population), and people fully vaccinated.

- For total doses distributed per state, users will be able to see total doses distributed, total doses distributed rate (per 100K of total population), and people fully vaccinated.

In addition, the Covid19 Global Counts of Cases & Deaths is included for users to see how the United States' counts of cases and deaths compare to others globally in general.

## Datasets
[WHO_Covid19_Global_Data](https://covid19.who.int/data)

[covid_cases](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#cases_casesper100klast7days)

[covid_vaccine](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total)

[states_lat_long](https://developers.google.com/public-data/docs/canonical/states_csv)

## Data Cleaning/Manipulation & Conversion
The vlookup formula was used to find and place the latitude and longitude from the [states_lat_long](Resources/states_lat_long.csv) file into the [covid_cases](Resources/covid_cases.csv) and [covid_vaccine](Resources/covid_vaccine.csv) files.


Pandas was used for data cleaning/manipulation and conversion. 

Certain columns were selected from the [merged_covid_cases](Resources/merged_covid_cases.csv) and [merged_covid_vaccine](Resources/merged_covid_vaccine.csv) files to be placed into 2 separate dataframes and saved as csv files.

Also, rows with data for territories were dropped/ excluded since we are only focusing on covid-19 in the states and wanted to use the states' data specifically for our leaflet map.

cleaned_covid_vaccine dataframe:
![covid_vaccine](Images/covid_vaccine.PNG)

The [WHO_Covid19_Global_Data](Resources/WHO_COVID19_Global_Data.csv) file was extracted into a dataframe and the data was saved as a html file after setting the "name" column as the index.

## Webscraping
The data in the dashboards in the [covid_cases](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#cases_casesper100klast7days) and [covid_vaccine](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total) websites were webscraped and placed into MongoDB. Flask was used to pull the data from MongoDB into the html file for display.

## Webpage Development
Website consists of 4 pages total, including:

### A landing page containing:
1. An summary of the website.
2. Links to each visualizations page. There should be a sidebar containing preview images of each visualization, and clicking an image should take the user to that visualization.

### Three visualization pages, each with:
1. A descriptive title.
2. The plot/visualization itself.
3. The Cases&Deaths page and Vaccine page both contains a dropdown button menu that provides a link to each individual visualization page. Also, the Cases&Deaths page contains a button that provides a link to the Global_Covid19_Data page too. 

### A "Data" page that:
1. Displays a responsive table containing data.
2. The table is a bootstrap table component. The data comes from exporting the .csv file as HTML, or converting it to HTML by using pandas. 

### The website, at the top of every page, have a navigation menu that:
1. Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
2. Provides two more text links on the right: "Cases & Deaths," which links to the Cases&Deaths page, and "Vaccine Distribution & Coverage," which links to the vaccine page.
3. Is responsive (using media queries). The nav must have similar behavior as the screenshots "Navigation Menu" section (notice the background color change).
4. The website is deployed to GitHub pages.


## Leaflet Plot Creation
### Get the Data Set
1. The URL below was used to convert the data in the [cleaned_covid_case](Resources/Cleaned_Files/cleaned_covid_case.csv) and [cleaned_covid_vaccine](Resources/Cleaned_Files/cleaned_covid_vaccine.csv) csv files to geojson files. 

https://www.convertcsv.com/csv-to-geojson.htm

2. The converted data was used to pull in the data for the visualization.

### Import and Visualize the Data
1. A choropleth map using leaflet plots all of the states from the data set based on their longitude and latitude.
2. Popups that provide Covid-19 information were included when the user hovers their mouse over a state
3. A legend was created to provide context for the map data

## Plotly Creation
3 horizontal bar charts were created showing:
- U.S. COVID-19 Vaccine Administration by Vaccine Type
- U.S. COVID-19 Vaccine Delivered by Vaccine Type
- Number of People Fully Vaccinated in the U.S. by COVID-19 Vaccine Series Type
